# Personal Profile Website

This is a personal profile website built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), designed to showcase my projects, skills, and background in a clean and user-friendly format. This project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Project Overview

This website serves as a personal portfolio and profile, featuring sections such as:
